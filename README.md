By using the weather data already retrieved let customers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Using this information, create a travel itinerary to four cities.  Then use the Google Maps Directions API, to create a travel route between the four cities and show a marker layer map.
